# CS532_project
This is my CS532_project_code, title: Machine learning approaches to predict forest fires <br/>
Hello, this is my CS532 project related document.  <br/>
forestfires.csv is the orignal data, forestfires.txt is the dataset description from original data set author. <br/>
Please download the forestfires.csv and run pro_processing.ipynb first to get the new training_data.csv, testing_data.csv, training_label.csv, testing_label.csv.<br/>
These four csv document is the data we need to conduct. <br/>
Method1_linear_regression.ipynb is the first approach, Method2_MLP.ipynb is the second approach,<br/>
Method3_SVM is the third approach. <br/>
CS_532_project_new.pdf is my project report. <br/>
